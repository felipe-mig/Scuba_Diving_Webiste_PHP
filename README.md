## 📒 How to run a local server

You can use MAMP or XAMPP as free options:

https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/

https://www.apachefriends.org/

MAMP EXAMPLE (XAMPP works in the same way):

If you followed the default installation parameters, the directory to run the local server should be on this path: 

   C:\MAMP

Steps to start the server:

1. Start the server by running the <strong>MAMP.exe</strong> file. Next, initiate the Apache Server and MySQL Server if they don't do it automatically

2. At the same directory level where MAMP.exe is located, look for the <strong>htdocs</strong> folder and delete it.

3. Replace the removed <strong>htdocs</strong> folder for the one on this project.

4. In your browser type the following URL: 

   127.0.0.1:80/phpMyAdmin5/
